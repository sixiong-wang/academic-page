# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
- I was graduated from [Chang'an University](https://www.chd.edu.cn/) in July 2021. Through 5 years of study, I received my Bachelor of Architecture degree from [Chang'an University's School of Architecture](https://jzx.chd.edu.cn/).

    During my intern at [Shenzhen Huahui Design Co., Ltd](http://www.hhd-sz.com/), I primarily worked on projects involving real estate developers and government initiatives in South China. Following my graduation, I made the deliberate choice to pursue advanced studies in architectural theory. As part of this endeavor, I enthusiastically joined a research workshop under the guidance of Professor [Nate Hume](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/nate-hume), Principal Architect [Finn Lam](), and Assistant Professor [Yu Yan](https://saup.szu.edu.cn/info/1094/2367.htm).


    My passion for architecture has never waned, and my academic interests focus on the abstract "**movement**" of architecture: how the internal, silent building narrates; and how the external, static space guides the behavior of the visitor.
