# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
- I graduated from [Chang'an University](https://www.chd.edu.cn/) in July 2021 with a [Bachelor of Architecture degree](https://jzx.chd.edu.cn/). Currently, I work at [Hainan Provincial Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd](https://www.hniad.com/html/index.html), focusing on architectural design projects in my hometown, Hainan. In addition to project design, I am working on establishing an AI-based algorithmic workflow for architecture.

    I have gained valuable practical experience, notably during my internship at [Shenzhen Huahui Design Co., Ltd](http://www.hhd-sz.com/). There, I delved into real estate finance models led by major developers and the government, contributing to the "Jumping Fun Land: Pressure Evacuation Park" project. Furthermore, during the pandemic, I worked for over a year at the [Xin Weipin Real Estate Leasing Operations Center](), continually delving into architectural theory.

    In the pursuit of academic progress, I actively participated in numerous academic workshops worldwide, receiving guidance from professionals such as [Nate Hume from UPenn](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/nate-hume), [Lifeng Lin from LIN Architecture](https://lin.archi/about), and [Yu Yan from SAUP](https://saup.szu.edu.cn/info/1094/2367.htm).


- My passion for architecture has never waned, and my academic interests focus on the abstract "**movement**" of architecture: internally, how buildings narrate through silent forms; and externally, how static spaces guide dynamic behaviors of visitors.
