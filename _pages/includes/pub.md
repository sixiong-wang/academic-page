- **My Roles** : Individual Work
- **Abstract** : In Lacan's Graph of Desire, a **drive** is mentioned. 
Its function is to castrate Jouissance to the margins of the body. The reflection of this castration on the body is the completion of the movement. 
In order to describe this drive, this project places the age after the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis as a carrier for narrative, bankers need to use a force to stimulate the financial. 
Bankers hijacked the drive and packaged it into a funland to save the age of jumping from buildings.

    Are bankers really preventing jumping from buildings, or are they even exploiting jumping from buildings, which is the last resort to relieve stress, to increase their own profit?
Suddenly, we realize that the work-led lifestyle is like obsessive-compulsive disorder, pushed by **an invisible force**.
- Now, do you know what this **force** is?

**Rethinking the Role of the Architect, Utopia Architectural Theory Research Project**

- **My Roles** : Team leader, 70% theoretical research, 40% modelling, 40% drawing
- **Abstract** : The relationship between real estate companies and architects is gradually shifting from a client-servicer to a space customer-developer relationship.

    In this process of architects gradually gaining/reclaiming their autonomy, a state of time and space in which they can find their belonging, reflect on the rules and regulations, and awaken their sense of autonomy has become a necessity for the development of space.

    Under ideal infrastructural conditions, the purely spatial design sector is liberated from the tedious functional requirements and caustic constraints of the system. A spatial orientation that is naturally free of representations is the logical choice to support the autonomy of architects.

- **My Roles** : Team leader, 50% theoretical research, 30% modelling, 40% drawing
- **Abstract** : The dichotomy between city and countryside is an issue of modernity that has been constructed in a vast historical logic since the existence of cities. The dichotomy between the countryside and the city is embedded in a certain narrative of modernity about "disconnection". The agrarian-based Third World countries, as a place of sharp conflict between urban and rural areas, the heterogeneity of the urban-rural divide is infinitely magnified. Peasants in South Asia are persecuted in the midst of global climate problems and food crises.

- We have tried to create a reformation of life between urban and rural areas and named it "Bees and Orchids" rescue approach. By giving them the identity of "bees" under Deleuze's tuber theory, they, like "bees", stay rhythmically in the city as an "orchid", using the basic resources of the city and the natural resources of the journey for self-sufficiency in the process of moving around, the heterogeneity of the urban-rural divide is perfected in the process of honey gathering and pollination by bees. In the process of nectar gathering and pollination, the heterogeneity between urban and rural areas completes the life chain of urban-rural habitat integration and reproduction.

    As a last resort for the "homeless" peasant community, the self-sufficient lifestyle is sought through a dense water system that follows the monsoon rhythm between watershed and land. The ritual of self-help critiques the unequal exercise of state power between rural and urban areas in South Asia, while questioning the value of standard property and land rights in this context. Opposing the continued subjugation of displaced and marginalized people, it seeks to promote local wisdom, cultural identity and hybrid ecology.

- **My Roles** : Lead idea, designer of the ninth box, typology research, diagram drawing
- **Abstract** : The development of the times has brought about tremendous changes, and "exquisite egoism" has emerged as the times require. Those sad cries from the bottom of society seem to no longer penetrate the "earplugs" made by people themselves. Faced with the increasingly indifferent public, we hope to melt the ice. As a type of architecture widely participated by the public, memorial buildings should be able to carry certain social enlightenment significance. Therefore, we choose comfort women as a special group to commemorate, to commemorate the original intention as the fulcrum, and to use the way of dissemination as a monument to arouse the emotional connection of the past crowd.

- These schemes may "disappear" in the future, and the structure after "disappearance" will be the legacy record of the disappeared objects.
In the future, when a person/group wants to match their memorial with some emotion or purpose, these programs will be reconstructed to make their voice heard. And the act of rebuilding is Materialize, an abstract act we think of as "commemoration".

    Through these actions, the public's attention to the vulnerable groups at the bottom of society can be raised, thus arousing the general lack of concern consciousness in modern society.
